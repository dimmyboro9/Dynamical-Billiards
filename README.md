# Dynamical-Billiards
Theory of chaos studies the behavior of so-called dynamical billiards. These are simple models describing the motion of a small ball in a plane confined by obstacles, where perfectly elastic reflections occur upon collision. The goal of this project is to create a simulation of these billiards using the Julia programming language.
